    "long_description": "BOOTSTRAP CHANGES\n=================\n\nThe `bootstrap` cookbook's recipes for configuring a RubyGem installation of Chef have been merged into this cookbook.\n\n    bootstrap::client -> chef::bootstrap_client\n    bootstrap::server -> chef::bootstrap_server\n\nBe aware of the following changes to this cookbook.\n\n* Bootstrap no longer generates a random password for the webui admin user. The default password is displayed on the webui login page and should be changed immediately after logging in.\n* Server configuration now has a setting for the cookbook tarballs. See the server.rb.erb template.\n* We now set the signing key/cert locations and set owner / group. See the server.rb.erb template.\n* The validation client name is configurable. See the attributes.\n\nDESCRIPTION\n===========\n\nThis cookbook is used to configure the system to be a Chef Client or a Chef Server. It is a complex cookbook, please read this entire document to understand how it works. For more information on how Chef itself works, see the [Chef Wiki](http://wiki.opscode.com)\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n============\n\nChef 0.8.x or higher is required.\n\nPlatform\n--------\n\nIf using this cookbook to manage a Chef Server system that was installed from Debian/Ubuntu packages, note that the configuration files are split up for server.rb, solr.rb and webui.rb, and the `chef::server` recipe may not work as desired.\n\n`chef::client` is tested on Ubuntu 8.04+, Debian 5.0, CentOS 5.x, Fedora 10+, OpenBSD 4.6, FreeBSD 7.1 and Gentoo.\n\n`chef::bootstrap_client` is tested on the above. OpenSolaris 11 is also tested, but there's a bug in Ohai that requires some manual intervention (OHAI-122).\n\n`chef::server` is tested on Ubuntu 8.04+, Debian 5.0.\n\n`chef::bootstrap_server` is tested on Ubuntu 8.04+, Debian 5.0.\n\nClient\n------\n\n`runit` cookbook is suggested for RubyGems installation. No other cookbooks are required for clients.\n\nServer\n------\n\nThe `chef::bootstrap_server` recipe uses the following other cookbooks from the Opscode repo.\n\n    couchdb\n    rabbitmq_chef\n    openssl\n    zlib\n    xml\n    java\n\nThe `chef::server_proxy` recipe uses the following cookbook:\n\n* apache2\n\nATTRIBUTES\n==========\n\nThe attributes for configuring the `chef` cookbook are under the `chef` namespace on the node, i.e., `@node[:chef]` or `@node.chef`.\n\numask\n-----\n\nSets the umask for files created by the server process via `Chef::Config[:umask]` in `/etc/chef/server.rb`\n\nurl_type\n--------\n\nSet up the URLs the client should connect to with this. Default is `http`, which tells the client to connect to `http://server:4000`. If you set up your chef-server to use an SSL front-end for example with `chef::server_proxy`, set this to `https` for clients and the URLs will be `https://server/`.\n\nBy default the only URL config setting for Chef 0.8.x+ is `Chef::Config[:chef_server_url]`. The other older URLs are still supported so you can split out the various functions of the Chef Server, but configuration of those is outside the scope of this cookbook.\n\ninit_style\n----------\n\nSpecifies the init style to use. Default `runit`. Other possible values `init`, `bsd`, any other string will be treated as unknown.\n\nIf your platform doesn't have a `runit` package or if the cookbook doesn't detect it, but you still want to use runit, set `init_style` to `none` and install runit separately.\n\npath\n----\n\nThis is the base location where Chef will store data and other artifacts. Default `/srv/chef` for RubyGems installed systems. If using Chef packages for your platform, the location preference varies. The default on Debian and Red Hat based systems is a filesystem hiearchy standard (FHS) suggestion. Some other locations you may consider, by platform:\n\nDebian and Red Hat based Linux distros (Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, etc):\n\n* `/var/lib/chef`\n\nAny BSD and Gentoo:\n\n* `/var/chef`\n\nrun_path\n--------\n\nLocation for pidfiles on systems using init scripts. Default `/var/run/chef`.\n\nIf `init_style` is `init`, this is used, and should match what the init script itself uses for the PID files.\n\ncache_path\n----------\n\nLocation where the client will cache cookbooks and other data. Default is `cache` underneath the `chef[:path]` location. Linux distributions might prefer `/var/cache/chef` instead.\n\nBase directory for data that is easily regenerated such as cookbook tarballs (`Chef::Config[:cookbook_tarballs]`) on the server, downloaded cookbooks on the client, etc. See the config templates.\n\nserve_path\n----------\n\nUsed by the Chef server as the base location to \"serve\" cookbooks, roles and other assets. Default is `/srv/chef`.\n\nserver_version\n--------------\n\nVersion of Chef to install for the server. Used by the `server_proxy` recipe to set the location of the DocumentRoot of the WebUI.\n\nclient_version\n--------------\n\nVersion of Chef to install for the client. Used to display a log message about the location of the init scripts when `init_style` is `init`, and can be used to upgrade `chef` gem with the `chef::bootstrap_client` recipe.\n\nclient_interval\n---------------\n\nNumber of seconds to run chef-client periodically. Default `1800` (30 minutes).\n\nclient_splay\n------------\n\nSplay interval to randomly add to interval. Default `20`.\n\nlog_dir\n-------\n\nDirectory where logs are stored if logs are not sent to STDOUT. Systems using runit should send logs to STDOUT as runit manages log output. Default STDOUT when `init_style` is `runit`, otherwise the default is `/var/log/chef`.\n\nclient_log, indexer_log, server_log\n-----------------------------------\n\nLocation of the client, indexer and server logs, respectively. Default `STDOUT` on systems with runit, `/var/log/chef/{client,indexer,server}.log` on other systems.\n\nNote that `chef-indexer` is deprecated for `chef-solr-indexer`.\n\nserver_port\n-----------\n\nPort for the Server API service to listen on. Default `4000`.\n\nwebui_port\n----------\n\nPort for the Server WebUI service to listen on. Default `4040`.\n\nwebui_enabled\n-------------\n\nAs of version 0.8.x+, the WebUI part of the Chef Server is optional, and disabled by default. To enable it, set this to true.\n\nwebui_admin_password\n--------------------\n\nThe default password in the `Chef::Config` is `p@ssw0rd1`, which may not be desirable. Change the webui `admin` user's password with this attribute. Note that this may require the `chef-server-webui` service be restarted an additional time, and it should still be changed on first login with the `admin` user.\n\n\nserver_fqdn\n-----------\n\nFully qualified domain name of the server. Default is `chef.domain` where domain is detected by Ohai. You should configure a DNS entry for your Chef Server.\n\nOn servers, this specifies the URL the server expects to use by default `Chef::Config[:chef_server_url]`, plus it is used in the `server_ssl_req` as the canonical name (CN) and in `server_proxy` for the vhost name.\n\nOn clients, this specifies the URL the client uses to connect to the server as `Chef::Config[:chef_server_url]`.\n\nserver_ssl_req\n--------------\n\nUsed by the `server_proxy` recipe, this attribute can be used to set up a self-signed SSL certificate automatically using OpenSSL. Fields:\n\n* C: country (two letter code)\n* ST: state/province\n* L: locality or city\n* O: organization\n* OU: organizational unit\n* CN: canonical name, usually the fully qualified domain name of the server (FQDN)\n* emailAddress: contact email address\n\nRECIPES AND USAGE\n=================\n\nThis section describes the recipes in the cookbook and how to use them in your environment.\n\nbootstrap_client\n----------------\n\nONLY FOR RUBYGEMS INSTALLATIONS. Do not use this recipe if you installed Chef from packages for your platform.\n\nUse this recipe to \"bootstrap\" a client so it can connect to a Chef Server. This recipe does the following:\n\n* Ensures the gem installed matches the version desired (`client_version` attribute).\n* Sets up the `chef-client` service depending on the `init_style` attribute (see above).\n* Sets up some directories for Chef to use.\n* Creates the client configuration file `/etc/chef/client.rb` based on the configuration passed via JSON.\n\nMinimal JSON to use for the client configuration:\n\n    {\n      \"chef\": {\n        \"url_type\": \"http\",\n        \"init_style\": \"runit\",\n        \"server_port\": \"4000\",\n        \"path\": \"/srv/chef\",\n        \"server_fqdn\": \"localhost.localdomain\",\n      },\n      \"run_list\": \"recipe[chef::bootstrap_client]\"\n    }\n\nThis recipe is typically used with chef-solo. For more information see [Bootstrap Chef RubyGems Installation](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Bootstrap+Chef+RubyGems+Installation)\n\nbootstrap_server\n----------------\n\nONLY FOR RUBYGEMS INSTALLATIONS. Do not use this recipe if you installed Chef from packages for your platform.\n\nUse this recipe to \"bootstrap\" a system to become a Chef Server. This recipe does the following:\n\n* Includes the `chef::bootstrap_client` recipe to configure itself to be its own client.\n* Installs CouchDB from package or source depending on the platform.\n* Installs Java for the `chef-solr` search engine.\n* Installs RabbitMQ (`rabbitmq_chef` cookbook) for the `chef-solr-indexer` consumer.\n* Installs all the Server-related Gems.\n* Creates the server configuration file `/etc/chef/server.rb` based on the configuration passed via JSON. \n* Sets up some directories for the server to use.\n* Sets up the `chef-server`, `chef-solr`, `chef-solr-indexer` services depending on the `init_style` attribute (see above).\n\nMinimal JSON to use for the client configuration:\n\n    {\n        \"chef\": {\n          \"url_type\": \"http\",\n          \"init_style\": \"runit\",\n          \"path\": \"/srv/chef\",\n          \"server_port\": \"4000\",\n          \"serve_path\": \"/srv/chef\",\n          \"server_fqdn\": \"localhost.localdomain\",\n      },\n      \"run_list\": \"recipe[chef::bootstrap_server]\"\n    }\n\nNote that the `chef-server-webui` is optional and can be enabled if desired by adding this to the JSON under \"chef\":\n\n    \"webui_enabled\": true\n\nSee above about the `webui_admin_password` to use something other than the `Chef::Config` default.\n\nThis recipe is typically used with chef-solo. For more information see [Bootstrap Chef RubyGems Installation](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Bootstrap+Chef+RubyGems+Installation)\n\nclient\n------\n\nThe client recipe is used to manage the configuration of an already-installed and configured Chef client. It can be used after a RubyGems installation bootstrap (per above), or with clients that were installed from platform packaging.\n\nThe recipe itself manages the `/etc/chef/client.rb` config file based on the attributes in this cookbook. When the client config is updated, the recipe will also reread the configuration during the Chef run, so the way Chef runs can be dynamically changed.\n\ndefault\n-------\n\nThere is no spoon.\n\ndelete_validation\n-----------------\n\nThis is a standalone recipe that merely deletes the validation certificate (default `/etc/chef/validation.pem`). Use this if managing the client config file is not required in your environment.\n\nserver\n------\n\nThe server recipe includes the `chef::client` recipe above.\n\nThe recipe itself manages the services and the Server config file `/etc/chef/server.rb`. See above under Platform requirements for cavaet when running Chef Server installed via Debian/Ubuntu packages. Changes to the recipe to manage additional templates may be required.\n\nThe following services are managed:\n\n* chef-solr\n* chef-solr-indexer\n* chef-server\n* chef-webui (if installed)\n\nChanges to the `/etc/chef/server.rb` will trigger a restart of these services.\n\nSince the Chef Server itself typically runs the CouchDB service for the data store, the recipe will do a compaction on the Chef database and all the views associated with the Chef Server. These compactions only occur if the database/view size is more than 100Mb. It will use the configured CouchDB URL, which is `http://localhost:5984` by default.\n\nserver_proxy\n------------\n\nSets up an Apache2 VirtualHost to proxy HTTPS for the Chef Server API and WebUI.\n\nTEMPLATES\n=========\n\nchef_server.conf.erb\n--------------------\n\nVirtualHost file used by Apache2 in the `chef::server_proxy` recipe.\n\nclient.rb.erb\n-------------\n\nConfiguration for the client, lands in `/etc/chef/client.rb`.\n\nserver.rb.erb\n-------------\n\nConfiguration for the server and server components, lands in `/etc/chef/server.rb`. See above regarding Debian/Ubuntu packaging config files when using packages to install Chef.\n\nsv-*run.erb\n-----------\n\nVarious runit \"run\" scripts for the Chef services that get configured when `init_style` is \"runit\".\n\nLICENSE AND AUTHORS\n===================\n\n* Author: Joshua Timberman <joshua@opscode.com>\n* Author: Joshua Sierles <joshua@37signals.com>\n\n* Copyright 2008-2010, Opscode, Inc\n* Copyright 2009, 37signals\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n",
